# Running on OpenShift

This is a short documentation about how to spin up the Eclipse Kura™ simulator in OpenShift.

First of all you need some setup of [Eclipse Kapua™](https://eclipse.org/kapua "Eclipse Kapua™").
The easiest solution with OpenShift is to follow the readme in the Kapua GitHub repository: [dev-tools/src/main/openshift](https://github.com/eclipse/kapua/tree/develop/dev-tools/src/main/openshift "Setting up Kapua on OpenShift").

The rest of this documentation assumes that you did set up Kapua in OpenShift according to the above document.

    ./setup.sh
